## sortshow
This is a little program, written just for curious. It shows, how certain sorting method works (maybe not always properly).
It uses SFML libraby to visualize the process, so first you need to install SFML:
```
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```
Then you can build it in usual way using 'make', and it produces the execution file 'vis'
To start it, just type
```
./vis --insert
./vis --merge
```
